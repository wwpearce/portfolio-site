    "bodyCopy": "Hi! I'm Bill Pearce and I'm a Creative Technologist (WTF is a creative technologist). I've been working at creative agencies and tech companies for about thirteen years, wearing hats ranging from Art Director to Front-End Developer. Most recently, I worked at an internal creative agency inside Amazon, providing product and campaign solutions or clients. I split my time at Amazon working as the prototyping arm of a UX research team and as the technical guide in the advertising creative process. I can fit anywhere in the process of crafting user-centric products (UX, design, creative ideation, prototyping, development) but am most comfortable as the soft-technical arm of a small creative team. Whatever you're making, I can help you make it better!",
